# A symlink exists for the cronjob bash script in this directory, from /etc/cron.hourly/
# 
# The symlink allows datamining to occur on a scheduled basis
# 
#
# If renaming files, be sure to keep /etc/cron.hourly/ up to date
# 
# Also make sure that all symlinks in /etc/cron.hourly/ are owned by root.
#
# Finally, in the bash script, the current directory must be specified from / in order
# to properly activate the virtualenv.
