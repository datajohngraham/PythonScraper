JOHN GRAHAM's VERSION 3
This is the full cl_scrape_project, including experimental directories and 
production tools.

The project uses python 2.7.3 with a virtualenv used for installing beautifulsoup4

The virtualenv also had cython and lxml.
###cython lxml?

In particular, the raspberry pi virtualenv has been made portable so a reconstruction
is no longer necessary when switching between directories.


the venv constructor script will construct a virtual environment in the
local directory and pip install beautifulsoup4 in that virtual environment.


The new lxml parser in beautifulsoup has additional needs:
apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev
pip install cython
pip install lxml

these dependencies allow the beautifulsoup soup creator to use the 'lxml' parser,
which is much faster.
